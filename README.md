# Weekly Challenge #12 - Fools Cursor

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that rotates your cursor towards the interactive elements on the screen.** Today is April 1st, day of the pranks. For this challenge we're going to go back in the early days of the internet where websites would do all sorts of things based around cursors.

### Winners

* In first place, @evgenyvinnik wins $75. The idea behind the challenge was to have something people could put in on their website April 1st and this is exactly what this submission's React component does! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-12-fools-cursor/issues/2

* In second place, @NicolasRoelandt wins $50. Not only the cursor points to the nearest button, but the buttons also moves closer! This concept is used for a brilliant quizz game. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-12-fools-cursor/issues/3

* In third place, @nikpundik wins $25. This is a very conceptual game of light switches using the cursor to reveal hidden clues. I recommend trying it out at least once! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-12-fools-cursor/issues/4

* As honorable mention, I (@vjeux) submitted an entry where you have 10 cursors following each others and pointing towards the nearest button. I found that spring physics is highly under-used ;) https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-12-fools-cursor/issues/1
