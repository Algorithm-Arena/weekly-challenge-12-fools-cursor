# Weekly Challenge #12 - Fools Cursor

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that rotates your cursor towards the interactive elements on the screen.** Today is April 1st, day of the pranks. For this challenge we're going to go back in the early days of the internet where websites would do all sorts of things based around cursors.
